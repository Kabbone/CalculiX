Results obtained from CalculiX are in no way connected to ABAQUS.

If you compile the program from scratch using the source code, you will need the source code for the sparse linear equation solver ([SPOOLES.2.2(serial version)](http://www.netlib.org/linalg/spooles/spooles.2.2.html)) and the eigenvalue solver ([ARPACK (serial version)](https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng)) too. A new free sparse linear equation solver, [PaStiX](https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/pastix) has been tested and has prove to accelerate execution times up to a factor of 8! To reach this acceleration hwloc, parsec, scotch and PaStiX4CalculiX have to be downloaded and installed. This yields an acceleration up to a factor of 4\. For the factor of 8 the CUDA library from Nvidia has to be installed in order to compute on the GPU (only works for Nvidia cards). For details the user should consult the README.INSTALL file.

Available add-ons:

*   [a STEP-to-fbd, IGES-to-fbd, fbd-to-STEP and fbd-to-IGES converter](cgxCadTools.tar.bz2) (including Linux binaries). If you have questions on this tool please contact [_pascal.mossier@gmail.com_](mailto:pascal.mossier@gmail.com).
*   [a vda to fbd converter](vda2fbd-1.0.tar.gz). After exporting a CAD model in vda format, you can use this program to convert it in fbd format and read it into cgx. If you have questions on this tool please contact [_johannes.barner@web.de_](mailto:johannes.barner@web.de).
*   [a acis to fbd converter](acis2fbd.tar.gz). After exporting a CAD model in acis format (available in autoCAD), you can use this program to convert it in fbd format and read it into cgx. Splines and nurbs are not covered yet. This feature was coded by Roland Felde. Many thanks!
*   [a three-dimensional interpolation program](interpol3d.tar.bz2). Interpolates the results from a master frd-file onto the nodes in a slave frd-file.

Other software using CalculiX (not exhaustive):

*   [justinablack.com/pycalculix](http://justinablack.com/pycalculix).
*   An [adapter](https://github.com/precice/calculix-adapter) allows to couple CalculiX via [preCICE](http://www.precice.org/) to other solvers (e.g. OpenFOAM, SU2, or any in-house solver) for fluid-structure interaction.
